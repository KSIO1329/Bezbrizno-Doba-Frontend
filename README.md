# Bezbrizno Doba Frontend
A web app I created using ReactJS. This is just the frontend of the full stack website.

If you want to see it in action, please visit [this link](https://www.bezbriznodoba.com).

## Introduction

This is my first big project, and as such it took me 2-3 weeks to complete it.

When I started, I only had basic knowledge of HTML and CSS, and I was already experienced in Java.

During the process I learned coding in JavaScript, and creating a RESTful API in GoLang. However this was later abandoned because the site would be hosted using Apache, and I couldn't use my own dedicated server. 

So I basically had to learn and rewrite my whole backend in PHP, which only serves as a middleman between the frontend and the database.

## Summary
The project as a whole (backend included) was created using:
- JavaScript (JSX)
- HTML
- CSS
- PHP
- GoLang (abandoned)
- MySQL

Specifically for the frontend, I used the following libraries:
- React-Redux > for creating a data store and using it to sync my components with the database
- Axios > for making API calls to the backend
- React-Redux-Thunk > for making the API calls work asynchronously

## Plans for the future
I am somewhat new to web development, but I would like to learn how to do more full stack projects.

My current goal, as the time of writing this, is to learn to use:
- VueJS
- SASS
- JQuery
